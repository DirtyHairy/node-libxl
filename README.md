# What it is

Node.js bindings for [libxl](http://www.libxl.com/). Both Node 0.10 and Node
0.11 starting with 0.11.13 are supported.

# How to use it

## Installation

Pull the library into your project with `npm install libxl`
and require the module via

    var xl = require('libxl');

## API

### Usage

A new excel document is created via

    var xlsBook = new xl.Book(xl.BOOK_TYPE_XLS);

or

    var xlsxBook = new xl.Book(xl.BOOK_TYPE_XLSX);

(for xlsx documents). The document is written to disk via

    xlsBook.writeSync('file.xls');

and read back via

    xlsBook.loadSync('file.xls');

(async operations are not implemented atm).

The Javascript API closely follows the C++ API described in the
[libxl documentation](http://www.libxl.com/documentation.html).
For example, adding a new sheet and writing two cells works as

    var sheet = xlsBook.addSheet('Sheet 1');
    sheet.writeStr(1, 0, 'A string');
    sheet.writeNum(1, 1, 42);

Functions whose C++ counterpart returns void or an error status
have been implemented to return the respective instance, so it
is possible to chain calls

    sheet
        .writeStr(1, 0, 'A string');
        .writeNum(1, 1, 42);

Errors are handled by throwing exceptions.

Functions that return multiple values
by reference in C++ (like Book::dateUnpack) return a object with the return
values as properties.

In C++, the cell value getters on Sheet (e.g. Sheet::readStr) can store the cell
format in an optional second argument. In Javascript, this is implemented by
allowing for an optional JS object as second parameter which will receive the
format in its 'format' property.

**IMPORTANT:** The Javascript API enforces the types defined in its C++
counterpart for all function arguments; there is no implicit type casting. For
example, passing a Number to Sheet::writeStr will throw a TypeError instead of
silently converting the string to a number.

### Coverage

API coverage is a work in progress. At the moment, the Font, Format and Book
(except methods dealing with embedded pictures) classes are fully implemented,
and Sheet is about 50% covered (reading, writing, formatting and splitting cells
works fine).  Please see the jasmine specs and the class initializers
(Book::Initialize, Sheet::Initialize, Format::Initialize, Font::Initialize) for
a more detailed overview of what is currently supported
:).

## Unlocking the API

If you have purchased a licence key from XLware, you can call book.setKey in
order to unlock the library. As an alternative, you can build the key into the
bindings by modifying `api_key.h` and rebuilding the library via `node-gyp
rebuild` (you'll have to install node-gyp for this) or `npm install` in the
package directory.

## Platform support

The package currently supports Linux, Windows and Mac.

# How to contribute

I'll be happy to merge in all sensible pull requests. If you
implement a new API method, please add a short test to the
jasmine specs and a call to demo.js (if applicable).
