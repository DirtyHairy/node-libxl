# What it is

Node.js bindings for [libxl](http://www.libxl.com/). Both Node 0.10 and Node
0.11 starting with 0.11.13 are supported.

# How to use it

## Installation

Pull the library into your project with `npm install libxl`
and require the module via

    var xl = require('libxl');

## API

A new excel document is created via

    var xlsBook = new xl.Book(xl.BOOK_TYPE_XLS);

or

    var xlsxBook = new xl.Book(xl.BOOK_TYPE_XLSX);

(for xlsx documents). The document is written to disk via

    xlsBook.writeSync('file.xls');

and read back via

    xlsBook.loadSync('file.xls');

(async operations are not implemented atm).

The API closely follows the
[libxl documentation](http://www.libxl.com/documentation.html).
For example, adding a new sheet and writing two cells works as

    var sheet = xlsBook.addSheet('Sheet 1');
    sheet.writeStr(1, 0, 'A string');
    sheet.writeNum(1, 1, 42);

Functions whose C++ counterpart returns void or an error status
have been implemented to return the respective instance, so it
is possible to chain calls

    sheet
        .writeStr(1, 0, 'A string');
        .writeNum(1, 1, 42);

Errors are handled by throwing exceptions.

API coverage is a work in progress. At the moment, the Font class is fully
implemented, and the other three classes (Book, Sheet and Format) are covered
sufficiently to support reading and writing documents. Please see
the jasmine specs and the class initializers
(Book::Initialize, Sheet::Initialize, Format::Initialize, Font::Initialize)
for a more detailed overview of what is currently supported :).

## Unlocking the API

If you have purchased a licence key from XLware, you can
build it into the bindings by modifying `api_key.h` and
rebuilding the library via `node-gyp rebuild` (you'll have
to install node-gyp for this) or `npm install` in the package
directory. I might implement `book.setKey` at some point in the
future, too.

## Platform support

The package currently supports Linux, Windows and Mac.

# How to contribute

I'll be happy to merge in all sensible pull requests. If you
implement a new API method, please add a short test to the
jasmine specs and a call to demo.js (if applicable).

  Though node-libxl is rewritten from scratch, this
  package served as the starting point.
